        <p>Our journey started on September 6th, 2016 with open minds and open hearts. Not knowing what to expect, we all entered the next stage of our lives, hoping our future would change for the better. The first day of Devleague started and one by one, our minds started to melt with all the information being thrown at us. Confinding in each other about our frustrations, we created bonds that would last a lifetime. Friendships bloomed and our bonds grew stronger. As our time slowly came to end, we each thought of something that would represent the culmination of our time together. We came together and applied our skills in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL databases, and various frameworks to create this Full-Stack Application. This app was designed to identify popular locations in your area by utilizing your friends geotagged posts. Our vision was to enable the user to easily find trending spots that their friends have frequented. Thus frenZone was born...</p>
